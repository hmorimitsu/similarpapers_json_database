    "summary": " We present an in-depth examination of the effectiveness of radial basis function kernel (beyond Gaussian) estimators based on orthogonal random feature maps. We show that orthogonal estimators outperform state-of-the-art mechanisms that use iid sampling under weak conditions for tails of the associated Fourier distributions. We prove that for the case of many dimensions, the superiority of the orthogonal transform can be accurately measured by a property we define called the charm of the kernel, and that orthogonal random features provide optimal (in terms of mean squared error) kernel estimators. We provide the first theoretical results which explain why orthogonal random features outperform unstructured on downstream tasks such as kernel ridge regression by showing that orthogonal random features provide kernel algorithms with better spectral properties than the previous state-of-the-art. Our results enable practitioners more generally to estimate the benefits from applying orthogonal transforms. ",

    "summary": " Computing the partition function Z of a discrete graphical model is a fundamental inference challenge. Since this is computationally intractable, variational approximations are often used in practice. Recently, so-called gauge transformations were used to improve variational lower bounds on Z. In this paper, we propose a new gauge-variational approach, termed WMBE-G, which combines gauge transformations with the weighted mini-bucket elimination (WMBE) method. WMBE-G can provide both upper and lower bounds on Z, and is easier to optimize than the prior gauge-variational algorithm. We show that WMBE-G strictly improves the earlier WMBE approximation for symmetric models including Ising models with no magnetic field. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WMBE-G even for generic, nonsymmetric models. ",

    "summary": " Sparsity-based methods are widely used in machine learning, statistics, and signal processing. There is now a rich class of structured sparsity approaches that expand the modeling power of the sparsity paradigm and incorporate constraints such as group sparsity, graph sparsity, or hierarchical sparsity. While these sparsity models offer improved sample complexity and better interpretability, the improvements come at a computational cost: it is often challenging to optimize over the (non-convex) constraint sets that capture various sparsity structures. In this paper, we make progress in this direction in the context of separated sparsity \u2013 a fundamental sparsity notion that captures exclusion constraints in linearly ordered data such as time series. While prior algorithms for computing a projection onto this constraint set required quadratic time, we provide a perturbed Lagrangian relaxation approach that computes provably exact projection in only nearly-linear time. Although the sparsity constraint is nonconvex, our perturbed Lagrangian approach is still guaranteed to find a globally optimal solution. In experiments, our new algorithms offer a 10x speed-up already on moderately-size inputs. ",

In this paper, we study methods to accelerate power iteration in the stochastic setting by adding a momentum term. While in the deterministic setting, power iteration with momentum has optimal iteration complexity, we show that naively adding momentum to a stochastic method does not always result in acceleration. We perform a novel, tight variance analysis that reveals a \"breaking-point variance\" beyond which this acceleration does not occur. Combining this insight with modern variance reduction techniques yields a simple version of power iteration with momentum that achieves the optimal iteration complexities in both the online and offline setting. Our methods are embarrassingly parallel and can produce wall-clock-time speedups. Our approach is very general and applies to many non-convex optimization problems that can now be accelerated using the same technique.",

However, the amount of computation and memory required for kernel methods becomes the bottleneck when dealing with large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose Nested Nystrom Method (NNM) which achieves a delicate balance between the approximation accuracy and computational efficiency by exploiting the multilayer structure and multiple compressions. Even when the size of the kernel matrix is very large, NNM consistently decomposes very small matrices to update the eigen-decomposition of the kernel matrix. We theoretically show that NNM implicitly updates the principal subspace through the multiple layers, and also prove that its corresponding errors of rank-k PSD matrix approximation and kernel PCA (KPCA) are decreased by using additional sublayers before the final layer. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the decreasing property of errors of NNM with the additional sublayers through theexperiments on the constructed kernel matrices of real data sets, and show that NNM effectively controls the efficiency both for rank-k PSD matrix approximation and KPCA.

I propose a probabilistic model-based word embedding method which can recover interpretable embeddings, without big data. The key insight is to leverage mixed membership modeling, in which global representations are shared, but individual entities (i.e. dictionary words) are free to use these representations to uniquely differing degrees. I show how to train the model using a combination of state-of-the-art training techniques for word embeddings and topic models. The experimental results show an improvement in predictive language modeling of up to 63% in MRR over the skip-gram, and demonstrate that the representations are beneficial for supervised learning.

Here we develop a method for fitting threshold tests that is two orders of magnitude faster than the existing approach, reducing computation from hours to minutes. To achieve these performance gains, we introduce and analyze a flexible family of probability distributions on the interval [0, 1] \u2013 which we call discriminant distributions \u2013 that is computationally efficient to work with.

To do this, we propose a new dimension reduction technique, called iterative supervised principal components (ISPCs), which combines variable screening and dimension reduction and can be considered as an extension to the existing technique of supervised principal components (SPCs). Our empirical evaluations confirm that, although not foolproof, the proposed approach provides very good results on several microarray benchmark datasets with very affordable computation time, and it can also be very useful for visualizing high-dimensional data.

In this study, we explore whether one iteration of k-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with C at run-time, while improving the clustering objective remains effective. The tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is typically used to make training of generative models with exponentially many hidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical results on truncated variational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more efficient. The basic idea is to use a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear complexity of O(NCD) required for a full E-step to a sublinear complexity. Our main observation is that the linear dependency on C can be reduced to a dependency on a much smaller parameter G which relates to cluster neighborhood relations. We focus on two versions of partial variational EM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with O(NG\u00b2D), and variational k-means, scaling with O(NGD) per iteration. Empirical results show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of iterations to improve the clustering objective to same values as k-means. For data with many clusters, we consequently observe reductions of net computational demands between two and three orders of magnitude. More generally, our results provide substantial empirical evidence in favor of clustering to scale sublinearly with C. ",

Further, by modelling the time taken to complete a function evaluation, we show that, under a time constraint, asynchronous parallel TS achieves asymptotically lower regret than both the synchronous and sequential versions. These results are complemented by an experimental analysis, showing that asynchronous TS outperforms a suite of existing parallel BO algorithms in simulations and in an application involving tuning hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network.

    "summary": " Given a finite random sample from a Markov chain environment, we select a predictor that minimizes a criterion function and refer to it as being calibrated to its environment. If its prediction error is not bounded by its criterion value, we say that the criterion fails. We define the predictor\u2019s complexity to be the amount of uncertainty in detecting that the criterion fails given that it fails. We define a predictor\u2019s stability to be the discrepancy between the average number of prediction errors that it makes on two random samples. We show that complexity is inversely proportional to the level of adaptivity of the calibrated predictor to its random environment. The calibrated predictor becomes less stable as its complexity increases or as its level of adaptivity decreases. ",

    "summary": " We study theoretical properties of block solvers for the eigenvalue problem. Despite a recent surge of interest in such eigensolver analysis, truly block solvers have received relatively less attention, in contrast to the majority of studies concentrating on vector versions and non-truly block versions that rely on the deflation strategy. In fact, truly block solvers are more widely deployed in practice by virtue of its simplicity without compromise on accuracy. However, the corresponding theoretical analysis remains inadequate for first-order solvers, as only local and k-th gap-dependent rates of convergence have been established thus far. This paper is devoted to revealing significantly better or as-yet-unknown theoretical properties of such solvers. We present a novel convergence analysis in a unified framework for three types of first-order Riemannian solvers, i.e., deterministic, vanilla stochastic, and stochastic with variance reduction, that are to find top-k eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, in full generality. In particular, the issue of zero gaps between eigenvalues,to the best of our knowledge for the first time, is explicitly considered for these solvers, which brings new understandings, e.g., the dependence of convergence on gaps other than the k-th one. We thus propose the concept of generalized k-th gap. Three types of solvers are proved to converge to a globally optimal solution at a global, generalized k-th gap-dependent, and linear or sub-linear rate. ",

We bridge this gap for models that exhibit a bipartite structure, including, most notably, the Restricted/Deep Boltzmann Machine.

We show that the Gibbs sampler with a layerwise alternating scan order has its relaxation time (in terms of epochs) no larger than that of a random-update Gibbs sampler (in terms of variable updates). We also construct examples to show that this bound is asymptotically tight. Through standard inequalities, our result also implies a comparison on the mixing times.",

However, it opens a new challenge that under what conditions the nonconvex stochastic algorithms may find the global optima effectively despite their empirical success in applications. In this paper, we provide an answer that a stochastic gradient descent method with variance reduction, can be adapted to solve the nonconvex reformulation of the original convex problem, with a global linear convergence, i.e., converging to a global optimum exponentially fast, at a proper initial choice in the restricted strongly convex case.

We propose to include a subject-specific mean shift parameter for each data point such that a nonzeroparameter will identify its corresponding data point as an outlier. We adopt a regularization approach by imposing a roughness penalty on the regression function and a shrinkage penalty on the mean shift parameter.An efficient algorithm has been proposed to solve the double penalized regression problem. We discuss a data-driven simultaneous choice of two regularization parameters based on a combination of generalized cross validation and modified Bayesian information criterion. We show that the proposed method can consistently detect the outliers. In addition,we obtain minimax-optimal convergence rates for both the regression function and the mean shift parameterunder regularity conditions. The estimation procedure is shown to enjoy the oracle property in the sense that the convergence rates agree with the minimax-optimal rates when the outliers (or regression function) are known in advance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method has desired performance in identifying outliers under different scenarios. ",

    "summary": " Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals. ",

To minimize these costs, we are interested in identifying training patterns for which knowing the true labels maximally improves the learning performance. We approximate the true label noise by a model that learns the aspects of the noise that are class-conditional (i.e., independent of the input given the observed label). To select labels for correction, we adopt the active learning strategy of maximizing the expected model change. We consider the change in regularized empirical risk functionals that use different pointwise loss functions for patterns with noisy and true labels, respectively. Different loss functions for the noisy data lead to different active label correction algorithms. If loss functions consider the label noise rates, these rates are estimated during learning, where importance weighting compensates for the sampling bias. We show empirically that viewing the true label as a latent variable and computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters performs well across all considered problems. A maximum a posteriori estimate of the model parameters was beneficial in most test cases. An image classification experiment using convolutional neural networks demonstrates that the class-conditional noise model, which can be learned efficiently, can guidere-labeling in real-world applications.

    "summary": " Submodular extensions of an energy function can be used to efficiently compute approximate marginals via variational inference. The accuracy of the marginals depends crucially on the quality of the submodular extension. To identify the best possible extension, we show an equivalence between the submodular extensions of the energy and the objective functions of linear programming (LP) relaxations for the corresponding MAP estimation problem. This allows us to (i) establish the optimality of the submodular extension for Potts model used in the literature; (ii) identify the optimal submodular extension for the more general class of metric labeling; and (iii) efficiently compute the marginals for the widely used dense CRF model using a recently proposed Gaussian filtering method. Using both synthetic and real data, we show that our approach provides comparable upper bounds on the log-partition function to those obtained using tree-reweighted message passing (TRW) in cases where the latter is computationally feasible. Importantly, unlike TRW, our approach provides the first practical algorithm to compute an upper bound on the dense CRF model. ",

    "summary": " The goal in semi-supervised learning is to effectively combine labeled and unlabeled data. One way to do this is by encouraging smoothness across edges in a graph whose nodes correspond to input examples. In many graph-based methods, labels can be thought of as propagating over the graph, where the underlying propagation mechanism is based on random walks or on averaging dynamics. While theoretically elegant, these dynamics suffer from several drawbacks which can hurt predictive performance. Our goal in this work is to explore alternative mechanisms for propagating labels. In particular, we propose a method based on dynamic infection processes, where unlabeled nodes can be \"infected\" with the label of their already infected neighbors. Our algorithm is efficient and scalable, and an analysis of the underlying optimization objective reveals a surprising relation to other Laplacian approaches. We conclude with a thorough set of experiments across multiple benchmarks and various learning settings.",

We present a discriminative learning framework which optimizes the expected error rate under a budget constraint on the interval sizes. Most current methods for constructing prediction intervals offer guarantees for a single new test point. Applying these methods to multiple test points can result in a high computational overhead and degraded statistical guarantees. By focusing on expected errors, our method allows for variability in the per-example conditional error rates. As we demonstrate both analytically and empirically, this flexibility can increase the overall accuracy, or alternatively, reduce the average interval size. While the problem we consider is of a regressive flavor, the loss we use is combinatorial. This allows us to provide PAC-style, finite-sample guarantees. Computationally, we show that our original objective is NP-hard, and suggest a tractable convex surrogate. We conclude with a series of experimental evaluations.",

    "summary": " We propose a Topic Compositional Neural Language Model (TCNLM), a novel method designed to simultaneously capture both the global semantic meaning and the local word-ordering structure in a document. The TCNLM learns the global semantic coherence of a document via a neural topic model, and the probability of each learned latent topic is further used to build a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model, where each expert (corresponding to one topic) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that accounts for learning the local structure of a word sequence. In order to train the MoE model efficiently, a matrix factorization method is applied, by extending each weight matrix of the RNN to be an ensemble of topic-dependent weight matrices. The degree to which each member of the ensemble is used is tied to the document-dependent probability of the corresponding topics. Experimental results on several corpora show that the proposed approach outperforms both a pure RNN-based model and other topic-guided language models. Further, our model yields sensible topics, and also has the capacity to generate meaningful sentences conditioned on given topics. ",

We propose the completeID algorithm, which exploits the non-uniformity of the observation, to analyze the completability of the input instead of blindly applying completion. Balancing statistical accuracy with computational efficiency, we relate completability to edge-connectivity of the graph associated with the input partially-observed matrix. We develop the MaxKCD algorithm for finding maximally k-edge-connected components efficiently. Experiments across datasets from a variety of applications demonstrate not only the success of completeID but also the importance of completability analysis. ",

In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of dropout for MF, where Bernoulli random variables are used to drop columns of the factors. We demonstrate the equivalence between dropout and a fully deterministic model for MF in which the factors are regularized by the sum of the product of squared Euclidean norms of the columns. Additionally, we inspect the case of a variable sized factorization and we prove that dropout achieves the global minimum of a convex approximation problem with (squared) nuclear norm regularization. As a result, we conclude that dropout can be used as a low-rank regularizer with data dependent singular-value thresholding. ",

In this paper, we pro- pose a new regularization method, \u201cIndependently Interpretable Lasso\u201d (IILasso).

To overcome this difficulty, in this work we consider a lifted variant of the Moreau-Yosida regularized model and propose a novel multiblock primal-dual algorithm that intrinsically stabilizes the dual block. We provide a complete convergence analysis of our algorithm and identify respective optimality qualifications under which stationarity of the original model is retrieved at convergence. Numerically, we demonstrate the relevance of Moreau-Yosida regularized models and the efficiency of our algorithm on robust regression as well as joint feature selection and semi-supervised learning.

The arms are divided into different groups, each of which has a common parameter. Therefore, when the player selects an arm at each time slot, information of other arms in the same group is also revealed. This regional bandit model naturally bridges the non-informative bandit setting where the player can only learn the chosen arm, and the global bandit model where sampling one arms reveals information of all arms. We propose an efficient algorithm, UCB-g, that solves the regional bandit problem by combining the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and greedy principles. Both parameter-dependent and parameter-free regret upper bounds are derived. We also establish a matching lower bound, which proves the order-optimality of UCB-g. Moreover, we propose SW-UCB-g, which is an extension of UCB-g for a non-stationary environment where the parameters slowly vary over time. ",

We show that for such problems, detection procedures based on sequential likelihood ratios with simple one-sample update estimates such as online mirror descent are nearly second-order optimal. This means that the upper bound for the algorithm performance meets the lower bound asymptotically up to a log-log factor in the false-alarm rate when it tends to zero. This is a blessing, since although the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistics are optimal theoretically, but they cannot be computed recursively, and their exact computation usually requires infinite memory of historical data. We prove the nearly second-order optimality by making a connection between sequential change-point detection and online convex optimization and leveraging the logarithmic regret bound property of online mirror descent algorithm. Numerical examples validate our theory. ",

The key advantage of this approach is that it uses a suite of strategies to balance exploration and exploitation and thus can efficiently handle the optimisation of a variety of functions with small to large number of local extrema. Another advantage is that it automatically determines the batch size within a specified budget avoiding unnecessary function evaluations. Theoretical analysis shows that the regret not only reduces sub-linearly but also by an additional reduction factor determined by the batch size. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by optimising a variety of benchmark functions, performing hyperparameter tuning of support vector regression and classification, and finally heat treatment process of an Al-Sc alloy. Comparisons with recent baseline algorithms confirm the usefulness of our algorithm. ",

This paper is devoted to the study of a kernel smoothing based competitor built from a sequence of $n\\geq 1$ i.i.d random vectors with arbitrary continuous probability distribution $f(x)dx$, originally proposed in Delyon et al. (2016), from a nonasymptotic perspective. We establish a probability bound showing that the method under study, though biased, produces an estimate approximating the target integral $\\int_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d}\\varphi(x)dx$ with an error bound of order $o(1/\\sqrt{n})$ uniformly over a class $\\Phi$ of functions $\\varphi$,under weak complexity/smoothness assumptions related to the class $\\Phi$, outperforming Monte-Carlo procedures. This striking result is shown to derive from an appropriate decomposition of the maximal deviation between the target integrals and their estimates, highlighting the remarkable benefit to averaging strongly dependent terms regarding statistical accuracy in this situation. The theoretical analysis then rests on sharp probability inequalities for degenerate $U$-statistics. It is illustrated by numerical results in the context of covariate shift regression, providing empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach. ",

This work presents a rigorous statistical analysis of GANs providing straight-forward explanations for common training pathologies such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, it proposes a new training objective, Kernel GANs and demonstrates its practical effectiveness on large-scale real-world data sets. A key element in the analysis is the distinction between training with respect to the (unknown) data distribution, and its empirical counterpart. To overcome issues in GAN training, we pursue the idea of smoothing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) by incorporating noise in the input distributions of the discriminator. As we show, this effectively leads to an empirical version of the JSD in which the true and the generator densities are replaced by kernel density estimates, which leads to Kernel GANs.",

It is demonstrated that learn- ing of the resulting symmetric VAE (sVAE) has close connections to previously developed adversarial-learning methods. This relationship helps unify the previously distinct techniques of VAE and adversarially learning, and provides insights that allow us to ameliorate shortcomings with some previously developed adversarial methods.

We develop a new generative model called Generative Matching Network which is inspired by the recently proposed matching networks for one-shot learning in discriminative tasks. By conditioning on the additional input dataset, our model caninstantly learn new concepts that were not available in the training data but conform to a similar generative process. The proposed framework does not explicitly restrict diversity of the conditioning data and also does not require an extensive inference procedure for training or adaptation. Our experiments on the Omniglot dataset demonstrate that Generative Matching Networks significantly improve predictive performance on the fly as more additional data is available and outperform existing state of the art conditional generative models.

    "summary": " In many biomedical, science, and engineering problems, one must sequentially decide which action to take next so as to maximize rewards. One general class of algorithms for optimizing interactions with the world, while simultaneously learning how the world operates, is the multi-armed bandit setting and, in particular, the contextual bandit case. In this setting, for each executed action, one observes rewards that are dependent on a given \u2019context\u2019, available at each interaction with the world. The Thompson sampling algorithm has recently been shown to enjoy provable optimality properties for this set of problems, and to perform well in real-world settings. It facilitatesgenerative and interpretable modeling of the problem at hand. Nevertheless, the design and complexity of the model limit its application, since one must both sample from the distributions modeled and calculate their expected rewards. We here show how these limitations can be overcome using variational inference to approximate complex models, applying to the reinforcement learning case advances developed for the inference case in the machine learning community over the past two decades. We consider contextual multi-armed bandit applications where the true reward distribution is unknown and complex, which we approximate with a mixture model whose parameters are inferred via variational inference. We show how the proposed variational Thompson sampling approach is accurate in approximating the true distribution, and attains reduced regrets even with complex reward distributions. The proposed algorithm is valuable for practical scenarios where restrictive modeling assumptions are undesirable. ",

However, when labels are expensive, we are forced to select only a small subset of vectors $x_i$ for which we obtain the labels $y_i$. We propose a new procedure for selecting the subset of vectors, such that the ridge estimator obtained from that subset offers strong statistical guarantees in terms of the mean squared prediction error over the entire dataset of n labeled vectors. The number of labels needed is proportional to the statistical dimension of the problem which is often much smaller than d. Our method is an extension of a joint subsampling procedure called volume sampling. A second major contribution is that we speed up volume sampling so that it is essentially as efficient as leverage scores, which is the main i.i.d. subsampling procedure for this task. Finally, we show theoretically and experimentally that volume sampling has a clear advantage over any i.i.d. sampling when labels are expensive. ",

Moreover, BET can be easily paired with most batch optimizers, does not require any parameter-tuning, and compares favorably to existing stochastic and batch methods. We show that when the batch size grows exponentially with the number of outer iterations, BET achieves optimal O (1/epsilon) data-access convergence rate for strongly convex objectives.

Despite an abundance of observations thanks to parallel experiments, current BO techniques have been limited to merely a few thousand observations. In this paper, we propose ensemble Bayesian optimization (EBO) to address three current challenges in BO simultaneously: (1)large-scale observations; (2) high dimensional input spaces; and (3) selections of batch queries that balance quality and diversity. The key idea of EBO is to operate on an ensemble of additive Gaussian process models, each of which possesses a randomized strategy to divide and conquer.We show unprecedented, previously impossible results of scaling up BO to tens of thousands of observations within minutes of computation.",

The method is appropriate for jointly modeling hundreds of time series with widely varying, non-stationary dynamics.

Within a cluster, all time series are modeled jointly using a novel \u201ctemporally-reweighted\u201d extension of the Chinese restaurant process mixture. Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are used to obtain samples from the posterior distribution, which are then used to form predictive inferences. We apply the technique to challenging forecasting and imputation tasks using seasonal flu data from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy and competitive imputation accuracy as compared to multiple widely used baselines. We further show that the model discovers interpretable clusters in datasets with hundreds of time series, using macroeconomic data from the Gapminder Foundation. ",

However, those kernels suffer from diagonal dominance of the Gram matrix and a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the sample size. In this work, we study a family of alignment-aware positive definite (p.d.) kernels, with its feature embedding given by a distribution of Random Warping Series (RWS). The proposed kernel does not suffer from the issue of diagonal dominance while naturally enjoys a Random Features (RF) approximation, which reduces the computational complexity of existing DTW-based techniques from quadratic to linear in terms of both the number and the length of time-series. We also study the convergence of the RF approximation for the domain of time series of unbounded length. Our extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RWS outperforms or matches state-of-the-art classification and clustering methods in both accuracy and computational time. ",

While replacing a model to a heavy-tailed one (e.g., from Gaussian to Student-t)is a standard approach for robustification, it can only be applied to simple models. In this paper, based on Zellner\u2019s optimization and variational formulation of Bayesian inference, we propose an outlier-robust pseudo-Bayesian variational method by replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence used for data fitting to a robust divergence such as the beta- and gamma-divergences. An advantage of our approach is that superior but complex models such as deep networks can also be handled. We theoretically prove that, for deep networks with ReLU activation functions, the influence function in our proposed method is bounded, while it is unbounded in the ordinary variational inference. This implies that our proposed method is robust to both of input and output outliers, while the ordinary variational method is not. We experimentally demonstrate that our robust variational method outperforms ordinary variational inference in regression and classification with deep networks. ",

Using a new gradient estimator for the resulting unnormalized proposal distribution, we achieve average improvements of 3.71 nats and 0.31 nats over state-of-the-art single-sample and multi-sample alternatives respectively for estimating marginal log-likelihoods using sigmoid belief networks on the MNIST dataset. We show both theoretically and empirically how explicitly rejecting samples, while seemingly challenging to analyze due to the implicit nature of the resulting unnormalized proposal distribution, can have benefits over the competing state-of-the-art alternatives based on importance weighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach via experiments on synthetic data and a benchmark density estimation task with sigmoid belief networks over the MNIST dataset. ",

    "summary": " In this paper, we propose a generalization of the best arm identification problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) to the setting where every pull of an arm is associated with delayed feedbacks. The delay in feedbacks increases the effective sample complexity of the algorithm, but can be offset by partial feedbacksreceived before a pull is completed. We propose a a general modeling framework to structure in the partial feedbacks, and as a special case we introduce efficient algorithms for best arm identification in settings where the partial feedbacks are biased or unbiased estimators of the final outcome of the pull. Additionally, we propose a novel extension of the algorithms to the parallel MAB setting where an agent can control a batch of arms. Experiments on simulated as well as real world datasets of policy search for charging chemical batteries and hyperparameter optimization for mixed integer programming demonstrate that exploiting the structure of partial and delayed feedbacks can lead to significant improvements over baselines on both sequential and parallel MAB.

In our problem setting, we assume access to a class of stochastic experts, where each expert is a conditional distribution over the arms given a context. We propose upper-confidence bound (UCB) algorithms for this problem, which employ two different importance sampling based estimators for the mean reward for each expert. Both these estimators leverage information leakage among the experts, thus using samples collected under all the experts to estimate the mean reward of any given expert. This leads to instance dependent regret bounds of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\u03bb(\\pmb{\u03bc})\\mathcal{M}\\log T/\u2206\\right)$, where $\u03bb(\\pmb{\u03bc})$ is a term that depends on the mean rewards of the experts, $\u2206$ is the smallest gap between the mean reward of the optimal expert and the rest, and $\\mathcal{M}$ quantifies the information leakage among the experts. We show that under some assumptions $\u03bb(\\pmb{\u03bc})$ is typically $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$. We implement our algorithm with stochastic experts generated from cost-sensitive classification oracles and show superior empirical performance on real-world datasets, when compared to other state of the art contextual bandit algorithms.

Under a generative hypergraph model called \"d-wise hypergraph stochastic block model\" (d-hSBM) which naturally extends the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) from graphs to d-uniform hypergraphs, the fundamental limit on the asymptotic minimax misclassified ratio is characterized. For proving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that provably achieves the fundamental limit in the sparse hypergraph regime. For proving the optimality, the lower bound of the minimax risk is set by finding a smaller parameter space which contains the most dominant error events, inspired by the analysis in the achievability part. It turns out that the minimax risk decays exponentially fast to zero as the number of nodes tends to infinity, and the rate function is a weighted combination of several divergence terms, each of which is the Renyi divergence of order 1/2 between two Bernoulli distributions. The Bernoulli distributions involved in the characterization of the rate function are those governing the random instantiation of hyperedges in d-hSBM. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data validate our theoretical finding. ",

    "summary": " Entropic regularization is quickly emerging as a new standard in optimal transport (OT). It enables to cast the OT computation as a differentiable and unconstrained convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Sinkhorn algorithm. However, entropy keeps the transportation plan strictly positive and therefore completely dense, unlike unregularized OT. This lack of sparsity can be problematic in applications where the transportation plan itself is of interest. In this paper, we explore regularizing the primal and dual OT formulations with a strongly convex term, which corresponds to relaxing the dual and primal constraints with smooth approximations. We show how to incorporate squared $2$-norm and group lasso regularizations within that framework, leading to sparse and group-sparse transportation plans.On the theoretical side, we bound the approximation error introduced by regularizing the primal and dual formulations. Our results suggest that, for the regularized primal, the approximation error can often be smaller with squared $2$-norm than with entropic regularization.We showcase our proposed framework on the task of color transfer.

The obtained theoretical bounds are the first constant-factor bounds that also hold in the linear regime, i.e. when the number of deletions $\u03c4$ is linear in $k$. Our bounds depend on established parameters such as the submodularity ratio and some novel ones such as the inverse curvature.

Therapies designed for patients at risk of multiple diseases need to account for the shared impact they may have on related diseases to ensure maximum overall well-being.

We develop a semi-parametric Bayesian regression model for survival analysis with competing risks, which can be used for jointly assessing a patient\u2019s risk of multiple (competing) adverse outcomes. We construct a Hierarchical Bayesian Mixture (HBM) model to describe survival paths in which a patient\u2019s covariates influence both the estimation of the type of adverse event and the subsequent survival trajectory through Multivariate Random Forests. In addition variable importance measures, which are essential for clinical interpretability are induced naturally by our model. We aim with this setting to provide accurate individual estimates but also interpretable conclusions for use as a clinical decision support tool.

Here a fully non-parametric test for continuous data based on conditional mutual information combined with a local permutation scheme is presented. Numerical experiments covering sample sizes from $50$ to $2,000$ and dimensions up to $10$ demonstrate that the test reliably generates the null distribution. For smooth nonlinear dependencies, the test has higher power than kernel-based tests in lower dimensions and similar or slightly lower power in higher dimensions. For highly non-smooth densities the data-adaptive nearest neighbor approach is particularly well-suited while kernel methods yield much lower power. The experiments also show that kernel methods utilizing an analytical approximation of the null distribution are not well-calibrated for sample sizes below $1,000$. Combining the local permutation scheme with these kernel tests leads to better calibration but lower power.For smaller sample sizes and lower dimensions, the proposed test is faster than random fourier feature-based kernel tests if (embarrassingly) parallelized, but the runtime increases more sharply with sample size and dimensionality. Thus, more theoretical research to analytically approximate the null distribution and speed up the estimation is desirable.As illustrated on real data here, the test is ideally suited in combination with causal discovery algorithms.

VSMC melds variational inference (VI) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), providing practitioners with flexible, accurate, and powerful Bayesian inference. The VSMC family is a variational family that can approximate the posterior arbitrarily well, while still allowing for efficient optimization of its parameters.

Our algorithm, which can be interpreted as an inexact gradient descent algorithm on the multipliers, does not require to perform global inference iteratively and requires only a fixed number of stochastic clique-wise updates at each epoch to obtain a sufficiently good estimate of the gradient w.r.t. the Lagrange multipliers. We prove that the proposed algorithm enjoys global linear convergence for both the primal and the dual objectives.

    "summary": " In high dimension, it is customary to consider Lasso-type estimators to enforce sparsity. For standard Lasso theory to hold, the regularization parameter should be proportional to the noise level, which is often unknown in practice. A remedy is to consider estimators such as the Concomitant Lasso, which jointly optimize over the regression coefficients and the noise level. However, when data from different sources are pooled to increase sample size, noise levels differ and new dedicated estimators are needed. We provide new statistical and computational solutions to perform heteroscedastic regression, with an emphasis on functional brain imaging with magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG). When instantiated to de-correlated noise, our framework leads to an efficient algorithm whose computational cost is not higher than for the Lasso, but addresses more complex noise structures. Experiments demonstrate improved prediction and support identification with correct estimation of noise levels. ",

    "summary": " We propose a new technique that boosts the convergence of training generative adversarial networks. Generally, the rate of training deep models reduces severely after multiple iterations. A key reason for this phenomenon is that a deep network is expressed using a highly non-convex finite-dimensional model, and thus the parameter gets stuck in a local optimum. Because of this, methods often suffer not only from degeneration of the convergence speed but also from limitations in the representational power of the trained network. To overcome this issue, we propose an additional layer called the gradient layer to seek a descent direction in an infinite-dimensional space. Because the layer is constructed in the infinite-dimensional space, we are not restricted by the specific model structure of finite-dimensional models. As a result, we can get out of the local optima in finite-dimensional models and move towards the global optimal function more directly. In this paper, this phenomenon is explained from the functional gradient method perspective of the gradient layer. Interestingly, the optimization procedure using the gradient layer naturally constructs the deep structure of the network. Moreover, we demonstrate that this procedure can be regarded as a discretization method of the gradient flow that naturally reduces the objective function. Finally, the method is tested using several numerical experiments, which show its fast convergence.",

Using the idea of trajectory averaging, we further improve the rate of convergence by eliminating the logarithmic factor. Lastly, we propose a two-step algorithm for sparse online regression: a burn-in step using offline learning and a refinement step using a variant of truncated stochastic gradient descent. Under appropriate assumptions, we show the proposed algorithm produces near optimal sparse estimators. Numerical experiments lend further support to our obtained theory. ",

For inference with Sequential Monte Carlo, this automatically yields improvements such as locally-optimal proposals and Rao\u2013Blackwellization. The mechanism maintains a directed graph alongside the running program that evolves dynamically as operations are triggered upon it. Nodes of the graph represent random variables, edges the analytically-tractable relationships between them. Random variables remain in the graph for as long as possible, to be sampled only when they are used by the program in a way that cannot be resolved analytically. In the meantime, they are conditioned on as many observations as possible. We demonstrate the mechanism with a few pedagogical examples, as well as a linear-nonlinear state-space model with simulated data, and an epidemiological model with real data of a dengue outbreak in Micronesia. In all cases one or more variables are automatically marginalized out to significantly reduce variance in estimates of the marginal likelihood, in the final case facilitating a random-weight or pseudo-marginal-type importance sampler for parameter estimation.

    "summary": " Discrete labeling problems are often solved by formulating them as an integer program, and relaxing the integrality constraint to a continuous domain. While the continuous relaxation is closely related to the original integer program, its optimal solution is often fractional. Thus, the success of a relaxation depends crucially on the availability of an accurate rounding procedure. The problem of identifying an accurate rounding procedure has mainly been tackled in the theoretical computer science community through mathematical analysis of the worst-case. However, this approach is both onerous and ignores the distribution of the data encountered in practice. We present a novel interpretation of rounding procedures as sampling from a latent variable model, which opens the door to the use of powerful machine learning formulations in their design. Inspired by the recent success of deep latent variable models we parameterize rounding procedures as a neural network, which lends itself to efficient optimization via back propagation. By minimizing the expected value of the objective of the discrete labeling problem over training samples, we learn a rounding procedure that is more suited to the task at hand. Using both synthetic and real world data sets, we demonstrate that our approach can outperform the state-of-the-art hand-designed rounding procedures. ",

Here, ranking refers to partitioning the items into sets of pre-specified sizes according to theirs scores, which includes identification of the top-k items as the most prominent special case.The score of a given item is defined as the probability that it beats a randomly chosen other item.In practice, in particular when n is large, finding an exact ranking typically requires a prohibitively large number of comparisons. What comes to our rescue here is that in practice, one is usually content with finding an approximate ranking. In this paper we consider the problem of finding approximate rankings from pairwise comparisons. We analyze an active ranking algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and decides whether to stop or which pair of items to compare next, based on confidence intervals computed from the data collected in previous steps. We show that this algorithm succeeds in recovering approximate rankings using a number of comparisons that is close to optimal up to logarithmic factors. We also present numerical results, showing that in practice, approximation can drastically reduce the number of comparisons required to estimate a ranking.",

Our new prediction-constrained objective for training generative models coherently integrates supervisory signals even when only a small fraction of training examples are labeled.

The proposed model also learns a mapping between the latent clusters and expert labels, revealing the agreements and disagreements between experts.

The goal of this paper is to partially explain the performance of \u03b1-expansion and an LP relaxation algorithm on MAP inference in Ferromagnetic Potts models (FPMs). Our main results give stability conditions under which these two algorithms provably recover the optimal MAP solution.

    "summary": " Distribution regression has recently attracted much interest as a generic solution to the problem of supervised learning where labels are available at the group level, rather than at the individual level. Current approaches, however, do not propagate the uncertainty in observations due to sampling variability in the groups. This effectively assumes that small and large groups are estimated equally well, and should have equal weight in the final regression. We account for this uncertainty with a Bayesian distribution regression formalism, improving the robustness and performance of the model when group sizes vary. We frame our models in a neural network style, allowing for simple MAP inference using backpropagation to learn the parameters, as well as MCMC-based inference which can fully propagate uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach on illustrative toy datasets, as well as on a challenging problem of predicting age from images. ",

    "summary": " In a nutshell, submodular functions encode an intuitive notion of diminishing returns. As a result, submodularity appears in many important machine learning tasks such as feature selection and data summarization. Although there has been a large volume of work devoted to the study of submodular functions in recent years, the vast majority of this work has been focused on algorithms that output sets, not sequences. However, in many settings, the order in which we output items can be just as important as the items themselves. To extend the notion of submodularity to sequences, we use a directed graph on the items where the edges encode the additional value of selecting items in a particular order. Existing theory is limited to the case where this underlying graph is a directed acyclic graph. In this paper, we introduce two new algorithms that provably give constant factor approximations for general graphs and hypergraphs having bounded in or out degrees. Furthermore, we show the utility of our new algorithms for real-world applications in movie recommendation, online link prediction, and the design of course sequences for MOOCs. ",

Our unified analysis for approximate composite minimization generalizes and extends previous work to new settings.

In this paper, we propose to extend the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework with a new type of prior which we call \"Variational Mixture of Posteriors\" prior, or VampPrior for short. The VampPrior consists of a mixture distribution (e.g., a mixture of Gaussians) with components given by variational posteriors conditioned on learnable pseudo-inputs. We further extend this prior to a two layer hierarchical model and show that this architecture with a coupled prior and posterior, learns significantly better models. The model also avoids the usual local optima issues related to useless latent dimensions that plague VAEs. We provide empirical studies on six datasets, namely, static and binary MNIST, OMNIGLOT, Caltech 101 Silhouettes, Frey Faces and Histopathology patches, and show that applying the hierarchical VampPrior delivers state-of-the-art results on all datasets in the unsupervised permutation invariant setting and the best results or comparable to SOTA methods for the approach with convolutional networks.

Inference algorithms have been developed that work well on specific models or on parts of general models, but they require significant hand-engineering to apply to full-scale problems. Probabilistic programming (PP) enables the expression of rich probabilistic models, but inference remains a bottleneck in many applications. Factored inference is one of the main approaches to inference in graphical models, but has trouble scaling up to some hard problems expressible as probabilistic programs. We present structured factored inference (SFI), a framework that enables factored inference algorithms to scale to significantly more complex programs. Using models encoded in a PP language, SFI provides a sound means to decompose a model into submodels, apply an algorithm to each submodel, and combine results to answer a query. Our results show that SFI successfully reasons on models where standard factored inference algorithms fail due to computational complexity. SFI is nearly as accurate as exact inference and is as fast as approximate inference methods. ",

First-order methods often get stuck at saddle points, greatly deteriorating their performance. Typically, to escape from saddles one has to use second-order methods. However, most works on second-order methods rely extensively on expensive Hessian-based computations, making them impractical in large-scale settings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a generic framework that minimizes Hessian-based computations while at the same time provably converging to second-order critical points. Our framework carefully alternates between a first-order and a second-order subroutine, using the latter only close to saddle points, and yields convergence results competitive to the state-of-the-art. Empirical results suggest that our strategy also enjoys a good practical performance. ",

Previous work for discrete treatment/action spaces focuses on inverse probability weighting (IPW) and doubly robust (DR) methods that use a rejection sampling approach for evaluation and the equivalent weighted classification problem for learning. In the continuous setting, this reduction fails as we would almost surely reject all observations. To tackle the case of continuous treatments, we extend the IPW and DR approaches to the continuous setting using a kernel function that leverages treatment proximity to attenuate discrete rejection. Our policy estimator is consistent and we characterize the optimal bandwidth. The resulting continuous policy optimizer (CPE) approach using our estimator achieves convergent regret and approaches the best-in-class policy for learnable policy classes. We demonstrate that the estimator performs well and, in particular, outperforms a discretization-based benchmark. We further study the performance of our policy optimizer in a case study on personalized dosing based on a dataset of Warfarin patients, their covariates, and final therapeutic doses. Our learned policy outperforms benchmarks and nears the oracle-best linear policy. ",

    "summary": " Traditionally, ODE parameter inference relies on solving the system of ODEs and assessing fit of the estimated signal with the observations. However, nonlinear ODEs often do not permit closed form solutions. Using numerical methods to solve the equations results in prohibitive computational costs, particularly when one adopts a Bayesian approach in sampling parameters from a posterior distribution. With the introduction of gradient matching, we can abandon the need to numerically solve the system of equations. Inherent in these efficient procedures is an introduction of bias to the learning problem as we no longer sample based on the exact likelihood function. This paper presents a multiphase MCMC approach that attempts to close the gap between efficiency and accuracy. By sampling using a surrogate likelihood, we accelerate convergence to the stationary distribution before sampling using the exact likelihood. We demonstrate that this method combines the efficiency of gradient matching and the accuracy of the exact likelihood scheme. ",

As an example, consider an adaptive clinical trial where additional data points are more likely to be tested for treatments that show initial promise. Our surprising result implies that the average observed treatment effects would underestimate the true effects of each treatment.

In this paper, we introduce sparse linear isotonic models (SLIMs) for high-dimensional problems by hybridizing ideas in parametric sparse linear models and AIMs, which enjoy a few appealing advantages over both. In the high-dimensional setting, a two-step algorithm is proposed for estimating the sparse parameters as well as the monotone functions over predictors. Under mild statistical assumptions, we show that the algorithm can accurately estimate the parameters. Promising preliminary experiments are presented to support the theoretical results. ",

This allows us to solve Kronecker product regression and non-negative Kronecker product regression, as well as regularized spline regression. Our main technical result is then in extending TensorSketch to other norms. That is, TensorSketch only provides input sparsity time for Kronecker product regression with respect to the 2-norm.

    "summary": " Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) has become a popular method for learning parsimonious representations of data, a fundamental problem in machine learning and signal processing. While most work on SDL assumes a training dataset of independent and identically distributed (IID) samples, a variant known as convolutional sparse dictionary learning (CSDL) relaxes this assumption to allow dependent, non-stationary sequential data sources. Recent work has explored statistical properties of IID SDL; however, the statistical properties of CSDL remain largely unstudied. This paper identifies minimax rates of CSDL in terms of reconstruction risk, providing both lower and upper bounds in a variety of settings. Our results make minimal assumptions, allowing arbitrary dictionaries and showing that CSDL is robust to dependent noise. We compare our results to similar results for IID SDL and verify our theory with synthetic experiments.",

To address these deficiencies, we introduce HP-CONCORD, a highly scalable optimization method for estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix based on a regularized pseudolikelihood framework, without assuming Gaussianity. Our parallel proximal gradient method uses a novel communication-avoiding linear algebra algorithm and runs across a multi-node cluster with up to 1k nodes (24k cores), achieving parallel scalability on problems with up to \u2248819 billion parameters (1.28 million dimensions); even on a single node, HP-CONCORD demonstrates scalability, outperforming a state-of-the-art method. We also use HP-CONCORD to estimate the underlying dependency structure of the brain from fMRI data, and use the result to identify functional regions automatically.

Our formulation of the infinite dimensional model naturally defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert space corresponding to each layer. The approximation error is evaluated by the degree of freedom of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in each layer. We derive the generalization error bound of both of empirical risk minimization and Bayesian deep learning and it is shown that there appears bias-variance trade-off in terms of the number of parameters of the finite dimensional approximation.

DTMs assume that word co-occurrence statistics change continuously and therefore impose continuous stochastic process priors on their model parameters. These dynamical priors make inference much harder than in regular topic models, and also limit scalability. In this paper, we present several new results around DTMs. First, we extend the class of tractable priors from Wiener processes to the generic class of Gaussian processes (GPs). This allows us to explore topics that develop smoothly over time, that have a long-term memory or are temporally concentrated (for event detection). Second, we show how to perform scalable approximate inference in these models based on ideas around stochastic variational inference and sparse Gaussian processes. This way we can train a rich family of DTMs to massive data. Our experiments on several large-scale datasets show that our generalized model allows us to find interesting patterns that were not accessible by previous approaches. ",

Importantly, dynamic connectivity has been linked to individual differences in physiology, psychology and behavior, and has shown promise as a biomarker for disease. The state of the art in computational neuroimaging is to estimate the brain networks as relatively short sliding window covariance matrices, which leads to high variance estimates, thereby resulting in high overall error.This manuscript proposes a novel Bayesian model for dynamic brain connectivity. Motivated by the underlying neuroscience, the model estimates covariances which vary smoothly over time, with an instantaneous decomposition into a collection of spatially sparse components \u2013 resulting in parsimonious and highly interpretable estimates of dynamic brain connectivity. Simulated results are presented to illustrate the performance of the model even when it is mis-specified. For real brain imaging data with unknown ground truth, in addition to qualitative evaluation, we devise a simple classification task which suggests that the estimated brain networks better capture the underlying structure.

This paper propose a novel adaptive sample size second-order method, which reduces the cost of computing the Hessian by solving a sequence of ERM problems corresponding to a subset of samples and lowers the cost of computing the Hessian inverse using a truncated eigenvalue decomposition. Although the sample size is grown at a geometric rate, it is shown that it is sufficient to run a single iteration in each growth stage to track the optimal classifier to within its statistical accuracy. This results in convergence to the optimal classifier associated with the whole set in a number of iterations that scales with $\\log(N)$.

We present theory and experiments suggesting that the region where the proposed diagnostic is activated coincides with the convergence region. For a class of loss functions, we derive a closed-form solution describing such region.

While with a standard parametrization the MLE problem is not convex and hence hard to solve globally, our parametrization leads to a functional that is jointly convex in the Sharpe ratio and inverse volatility functions. The major difficulty with the resulting infinite-dimensional convex program is the shape constraint on the inverse volatility function. We propose to solve the problem by solving a sequence of finite-dimensional convex programs with increasing dimensions, which can be done globally and efficiently. We demonstrate that, when the goal is to estimate the Sharpe ratio function directly, the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimation method is superior to existing methods that estimate the mean and variance functions separately. When applied to a financial dataset, our method captures a well-known covariate-dependent effect on the Shape ratio. ",

The method yields a principled distance measure, provides a tool for visual inspection of deep generative models, and an alternative to linear interpolation in latent space.

For our general problem, we present an algorithm by combining multi-armed bandit algorithms and online learning methods. This algorithm admits a sublinear regret bound when the number of observation functions is constant. We also show that the dependency on the number of observation functions is inevitable unless additional assumptions are adopted. To mitigate this inefficiency, we focus on a special case of practical importance, in which the observed information is expressed through linear combinations of the original features. We propose efficient algorithms for this special case. Finally, we also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms by simulation studies using both artificial and real data. ",

    "summary": " The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions, that is two distributions supported on low-dimensional manifolds in much higher-dimensional spaces, is a crucial factor in the estimation of generative mod- els.It is therefore no surprise that optimal transport (OT) metrics and their ability to handle measures with non-overlapping sup- ports have emerged as a promising tool. Yet, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational bur- den of evaluating OT losses, (ii) their instability and lack of smoothness, (iii) the difficulty to estimate them, as well as their gradients, in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable method to train large scale generative models using an OT-based loss called Sinkhorn loss which tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into a differentiable and more robust quantity that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations with seam- less GPU execution. Additionally, Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Energy distance/Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) losses, thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT on the one hand, and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD, which comes with un- biased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function. ",

However, to improve accuracy in real-world problems, we typically need to learn separate weights for different groundings of the MLN. In this paper, we present an approach to perform efficient weight learning in MLNs containing high-dimensional, untied formulas. The fundamental idea in our approach is to help the learning algorithm navigate the parameter search-space more efficiently by a) tying together groundings of untied formulas that are likely to have similar weights, and b) setting good initial values for the parameters. To do this, we follow a hierarchical approach, where we first learn the parameters that are to be tied using a non-relational learner. We then use a relational learner to learn the tied-parameter MLN with initial values derived from parameters learned by the non-relational learner. We illustrate the promise of our approach on three different real-world problems and show that our approach yields much more scalable and accurate results compared to existing state-of-the-art relational learning systems.

    "summary": " In this paper we propose the multi-objective contextual bandit problem with similarity information. This problem extends the classical contextual bandit problem with similarity information by introducing multiple and possibly conflicting objectives. Since the best arm in each objective can be different given the context, learning the best arm based on a single objective can jeopardize the rewards obtained from the other objectives. To handle this issue, we define a new performance metric, called the contextual Pareto regret, to evaluate the performance of the learner. Essentially, the contextual Pareto regret is the sum of the distances of the arms chosen by the learner to the context dependent Pareto front. For this problem, we develop a new online learning algorithm called Pareto Contextual Zooming (PCZ), which exploits the idea of contextual zooming to learn the arms that are close to the Pareto front for each observed context by adaptively partitioning the joint context-arm set according to the observed rewards and locations of thecontext-arm pairs selected in the past. Then, we prove that PCZ achieves $\\tilde O (T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ Pareto regret where $d_p$ is the Pareto zooming dimension that depends on the size of the set of near-optimal context-arm pairs. Moreover, we show that this regret bound is nearly optimal by providing an almost matching $\u03a9(T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ lower bound. ",

In this work, we present a system called Turing for building MCMC algorithms for probabilistic programming inference. Turing has a very simple syntax and makes full use of the numerical capabilities in the Julia programming language, including all implemented probability distributions, and automatic differentiation. Turing supports a wide range of popular Monte Carlo algorithms, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), HMC with No-U-Turns (NUTS), Gibbs sampling, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and several particle MCMC (PMCMC) samplers. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it combines MCMC operations on subsets of variables, for example using a combination of an HMC engine and a particle Gibbs (PG) engine.We explore several combinations of inference methods with the aim of finding approaches that are both efficient and universal, i.e. applicable to arbitrary probabilistic models. NUTS\u2014a popular variant of HMC that adapts Hamiltonian simulation path length automatically, although quite powerful for exploring differentiable target distributions, is however not universal. We identify some failure modes for the NUTS engine, and demonstrate that composition of PG (for discrete variables) and NUTS (for continuous variables) can be useful when the NUTS engine is either not applicable, or simply does not work well. Our aim is to present Turing and its composable inference engines to the world and encourage other researchers to build on this system to help advance the field of probabilistic machine learning.",

    "summary": "Trial-and-error based reinforcement learning (RL) has seen rapid advancements in recent times, especially with the advent of deep neural networks. However, the majority of autonomous RL algorithms require a large number of interactions with the environment. A large number of interactions may be impractical in many real-world applications, such as robotics, and many practical systems have to obey limitations in the form of state space or control constraints. To reduce the number of system interactions while simultaneously handling constraints, we propose a model-based RL framework based on probabilistic Model Predictive Control (MPC). In particular, we propose to learn a probabilistic transition model using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to incorporate model uncertainty into long-term predictions, thereby, reducing the impact of model errors. We then use MPC to find a control sequence that minimises the expected long-term cost. We provide theoretical guarantees for first-order optimality in the GP-based transition models with deterministic approximate inference for long-term planning. We demonstrate that our approach does not only achieve state-of-the-art data efficiency, but also is a principled way for RL in constrained environments. ",

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) emerges as an alternative framework of likelihood-free inference methods. It identifies a quasi-posterior distribution by finding values of parameter that simulate the synthetic data resembling the observed data. A major ingredient of ABC is the discrepancy measure between the observed and the simulated data, which conventionally involves a fundamental difficulty of constructing effective summary statistics. To bypass this difficulty, we adopt a Kullback-Leibler divergence estimator to assess the data discrepancy. Our method enjoys the asymptotic consistency and linearithmic time complexity as the data size increases. In experiments on five benchmark models, this method achieves a comparable or higher quasi-posterior quality, compared to the existing methods using other discrepancy measures. ",

Bayesian optimization is method that heavily relies on probabilistic inference. This allows outstanding sample efficiency because the probabilistic machinery provides a memory of the whole optimization process. However, that virtue becomes a disadvantage when the memory is populated with outliers, inducing bias in the estimation. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bayesian optimization methods in the presence of outliers. The empirical evidence shows that Bayesian optimization with robust regression often produces suboptimal results. We then propose a new algorithm which combines robust regression (a Gaussian process with Student-t likelihood) with outlier diagnostics to classify data points as outliers or inliers. By using an scheduler for the classification of outliers, our method is more efficient and has better convergence over the standard robust regression. Furthermore, we show that even in controlled situations with no expected outliers, our method is able to produce better results.",

In the recent literature, there has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from graphon estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than the majority voting scheme for a setup that goes beyond the rank one models considered in the literature.

However, the E2C model suffers from two major drawbacks:1) its objective function does not correspond to the likelihood of the data sequence and2) the variational encoder used for embedding typically has large variational approximation error, especially when there is noise in the system dynamics. In this paper, we present a new model for learning robust locally-linear controllable embedding (RCE). Our model directly estimates the predictive conditional density of the future observation given the current one, while introducing the bottleneck between the current and future observations. Although the bottleneck provides a natural embedding candidate for control, our RCE model introduces additional specific structures in the generative graphical model so that the model dynamics can be robustly linearized. We also propose a principled variational approximation of the embedding posterior that takes the future observation into account, and thus, makes the variational approximation more robust against the noise. Experimental results show that RCE outperforms the E2C model, and does so significantly when the underlying dynamics is noisy. ",

Our method generalizes and improves over that of Globerson et al. (2015), who introduced the problem for two-dimensional grid lattices. For trees we provide a simple, efficient, algorithm that infers the ground truth with optimal Hamming error has optimal sample complexity and implies recovery results for all connected graphs. Here, the presence of side information is critical to obtain a non-trivial recovery rate. We then show how to adapt this algorithm to tree decompositions of edge-subgraphs of certain graph families such as lattices, resulting in optimal recovery error rates that can be obtained efficiently The thrust of our analysis is to 1) use the tree decomposition along with edge measurements to produce a small class of viable vertex labelings and 2) apply an analysis influenced by statistical learning theory to show that we can infer the ground truth from this class using vertex measurements. We show the power of our method in several examples including hypergrids, ring lattices, and the Newman-Watts model for small world graphs.

    "summary": " In this paper, we present a general algorithmic framework for developing easily parallelizable/distributable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.Our framework relies on the introduction of an auxiliary distribution called a \u2019shepherding distribution\u2019 (SD) that is used to control several MCMC chains that run in parallel. The SD is an introduced prior on one or more key parameters (or hyperparameters) of the target distribution.The shepherded chains then collectively explore the space of samples, communicating via the shepherding distribution, to reach high likelihood regions faster. The method of SDs is simple, and it is often easy to develop a shepherded sampler for a particular problem. Other advantages include wide applicability- the method can easily be used to draw samples from discrete distributions, or distributions on the simplex.Further, the method is asymptotically correct, since the method of SDs trivially maintains detailed balance.

We show that this family allows to recover ground truth clusters under different settings and verify this in real world data. While the matrix power mean is computationally expensive to compute we introduce a scalable numerical scheme that allows to efficiently compute the eigenvectors of the matrix power mean of large sparse graphs.

Approximate or coarse ranking can significantly reduce the number of ratings required in comparison to the number needed to find an exact ranking. We propose a computationally efficient PAC algorithm LUCBRank for coarse ranking, and derive an upper bound on its sample complexity. We also derive a nearly matching distribution-dependent lower bound. Experiments on synthetic as well as real-world data show that LUCBRank performs better than state-of-the-art baseline methods, even when these methods have the advantage of knowing the underlying parametric model.

    "summary": " There is increasing interest in learning algorithms that involve interaction between hu- man and machine. Comparison-based queries are among the most natural ways to get feed- back from humans. A challenge in designing comparison-based interactive learning algorithms is coping with noisy answers. The most common fix is to submit a query several times, but this is not applicable in many situations due to its prohibitive cost and due to the unrealistic assumption of independent noise in different repetitions of the same query. In this paper, we introduce a new weak oracle model, where a non-malicious user responds to a pairwise comparison query only when she is quite sure about the answer. This model is able to mimic the behavior of a human in noise-prone regions. We also consider the ap- plication of this weak oracle model to the problem of content search (a variant of the nearest neighbor search problem) through comparisons. More specifically, we aim at devising efficient algorithms to locate a target object in a database equipped with a dissimilarity metric via invocation of the weak comparison oracle. We propose two algorithms termed Worcs-I and Worcs-II (Weak-Oracle Comparison- based Search), which provably locate the tar- get object in a number of comparisons close to the entropy of the target distribution. While Worcs-I provides better theoretical guarantees, Worcs-II is applicable to more technically challenging scenarios where the algorithm has limited access to the ranking dis- similarity between objects. A series of experiments validate the performance of our proposed algorithms. ",

The BSP-Tree process is an almost surely right continuous Markov jump process that allows uniformly distributed oblique cuts in a two-dimensional convex polygon. The BSP-Tree process can also be extended using a non-uniform probability measure to generate direction differentiated cuts. The process is also self-consistent, maintaining distributional invariance under a restricted subdomain. We use Conditional-Sequential Monte Carlo for inference using the tree structure as the high-dimensional variable. The BSP-Tree process\u2019s performance on synthetic data partitioning and relational modelling demonstrates clear inferential improvements over the standard Mondrian process and other related methods.

Most recently, a range of prob- abilistic latent variable models applied to fMRI data have been successful in a variety of tasks, including identifying similarity pat- terns in neural data, combining multi-subject datasets, and mapping between brain and be- havior. Although these methods share some underpinnings, they have been developed as distinct methods, with distinct algorithms and software tools. We show how the matrix- variate normal (MN) formalism can unify some of these methods into a single frame- work. In doing so, we gain the ability to reuse noise modeling assumptions, algorithms, and code across models. Our primary theoretical contribution shows how some of these meth- ods can be written as instantiations of the same model, allowing us to generalize them to flexibly modeling structured noise covari- ances. Our formalism permits novel model variants and improved estimation strategies for SRM and RSA using substantially fewer parameters. We empirically demonstrate ad- vantages of our two new methods: for MN-RSA, we show up to 10x improvement in run- time, up to 6x improvement in RMSE, and more conservative behavior under the null. For MN-SRM, our method grants a modest improvement to out-of-sample reconstruction while relaxing the orthonormality constraint of SRM. We also provide a software prototyp- ing tool for MN models that can flexibly reuse noise covariance assumptions and algorithms across models. ",

PVI is a new method for optimizing the variational objective that constrains subsequent iterates of the variational parameters to robustify the optimization path. Consequently, PVI is less sensitive to initial- ization and optimization quirks and finds better local optima. We demonstrate our method on four proximity statistics. We study PVI on a Bernoulli factor model and sigmoid belief network fit to real and synthetic data and compare to deterministic annealing (Katahira et al., 2008). We highlight the flexibility of PVI by designing a proximity statistic for Bayesian deep learning models such as the variational autoencoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014) and show that it gives better performance by reducing overpruning. PVI also yields improved predictions in a deep generative model of text. Empirically, we show that PVI consistently finds better local optima and gives better predictive performance. ",

Our algorithm is built upon a natural stochastic model of learners and a novel submodular surrogate objective function which greedily selects interpretable teaching examples. We prove that NOTES is competitive with the optimal explanation-based teaching strategy. We further instantiate NOTES with a specific hypothesis class, which can be viewed as an interpretable approximation of any hypothesis class, allowing us to handle complex hypothesis in practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NOTES on several image classification tasks, for both simulated and real human learners. Our experimental results suggest that by leveraging explanations, one can significantly speed up teaching. ",

    "summary": " Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) can be thought of as quantum probabilistic graphical models that can model sequential data. We extend previous work on HQMMs with three contributions: (1) we show how classical hidden Markov models (HMMs) can be simulated on a quantum circuit, (2) we reformulate HQMMs by relaxing the constraints for modeling HMMs on quantum circuits, and (3) we present a learning algorithm to estimate the parameters of an HQMM from data. While our algorithm requires further optimization to handle larger datasets, we are able to evaluate our algorithm using several synthetic datasets generated by valid HQMMs. We show that our algorithm learns HQMMs with the same number of hidden states and predictive accuracy as the HQMMs that generated the data, while HMMs learned with the Baum-Welch algorithm require more states to match the predictive accuracy.

    "summary": " Advances in recovering low-rank matrices from noisy observations have led to tractable algorithms for clustering from general pairwise labels with provable performance guarantees. Based on convex relaxation, it has been shown that the ground truth clusters can be recovered with high probability under a generalized stochastic block model by solving a semidefinite program. Although tractable, the algorithm is typically too slow for sufficiently large problems in practice. Inspired by recent advances in non-convex approaches to low-rank recovery problems, we propose an algorithm based on projected gradient descent that enjoys similar provable guarantees as the convex counterpart, but can be orders of magnitude faster. Our theoretical results are further supported by encouraging empirical results.",

    "summary": " It has been experimentally observed that distributed implementations of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms exhibit speedup saturation and decaying generalization ability beyond a particular batch-size. In this work, we present an analysis hinting that high similarity between concurrently processed gradients may be a cause of this performance degradation. We introduce the notion of gradient diversity that measures the dissimilarity between concurrent gradient updates, and show its key role in the convergence and generalization performance of mini-batch SGD.We also establish that heuristics similar to DropConnect, Langevin dynamics, and quantization, are provably diversity-inducing mechanisms, and provide experimental evidence indicating that these mechanisms can indeed enable the use of larger batches without sacrificing accuracy and lead to faster training in distributed learning. For example, in one of our experiments, for a convolutional neural network to reach 95% training accuracy on MNIST, using the diversity-inducing mechanism can reduce the training time by 30% in the distributed setting.

    "summary": " In the most popular distribution testing and parameter estimation model, one can obtain information about an underlying distribution D via independent samples from D. We introduce a model in which every sample comes with the information about the probability of selecting it. In this setting, we give algorithms for problems such as testing if two distributions are (approximately) identical, estimating the total variation distance between distributions, and estimating the support size.The sample complexity of all of our algorithms is optimal up to a constant factor for sufficiently large support size. The running times of our algorithms are near-linear in the number of samples collected. Additionally, our algorithms are robust to small multiplicative errors in probability estimates. The complexity of our model lies strictly between the complexity of the model where only independent samples are provided and the complexity of the model where additionally arbitrary probability queries are allowed. Our model finds applications where once a given element is sampled, it is easier to estimate its probability. We describe two scenarios in which all occurrences of each element are easy to explore once at least one copy of the element is detected. ",

Most of them rely on a preselected kernel, whose prudent choice presumes task-specific prior information. To cope with this limitation, multi-kernel learning has gained popularity thanks to its flexibility in choosing kernels from a prescribed kernel dictionary. Leveraging the random feature approximation and its recent orthogonality-promoting variant, the present contribution develops an online multi-kernel learning scheme to infer the intended nonlinear function \u2018on the fly.\u2019 To further boost performance in non-stationary environments, an adaptive multi-kernel learning scheme is developed with affordable computation and memory complexity. Performance is analyzed in terms of both static and dynamic regret. To our best knowledge, AdaRaker is the first algorithm that can optimally track nonlinear functions in non-stationary settings with strong theoretical guarantees. Numerical tests on real datasets are carried out to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. ",

    "summary": " Sparse model selection is ubiquitous from linear regression to graphical models where regularization paths, as a family of estimators upon the regularization parameter varying, are computed when the regularization parameter is unknown or decided data-adaptively. Traditional computational methods rely on solving a set of optimization problems where the regularization parameters are fixed on a grid that might be inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a simple iterative regularization path, which follows the dynamics of a sparse Mirror Descent algorithm or a generalization of Linearized Bregman Iterations with nonlinear loss. Its performance is competitive to glmnet with a further bias reduction. A path consistency theory is presented that under the Restricted Strong Convexity and the Irrepresentable Condition, the path will first evolve in a subspace with no false positives and reach an estimator that is sign-consistent or of minimax optimal $\\ell_2$ error rate. Early stopping regularization is required to prevent overfitting. Application examples are given in sparse logistic regression and Ising models for NIPS coauthorship. ",

    "summary": " We study the convergence properties of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm in the Naive Bayes model. We show that EM can get stuck in regions of slow convergence, even when the features are binary and i.i.d. conditioning on the class label, and even under random (i.e. non worst-case) initialization. In turn, we show that EM can be bootstrapped in a pre-training step that computes a good initialization. From this initialization we show theoretically and experimentally that EM converges exponentially fast to the true model parameters. Our bootstrapping method amounts to running the EM algorithm on appropriately centered iterates of small magnitude, which as we show corresponds to effectively performing power iteration on the covariance matrix of the mixture model, although power iteration is performed under the hood by EM itself. As such, we call our bootstrapping approach \u201cpower EM.\u201d Specifically for the case of two binary features, we show global exponentially fast convergence of EM, even withoutbootstrapping. Finally, as the Naive Bayes model is quite expressive, we show as corollaries of our convergence results that the EM algorithm globally converges to the true model parameters for mixtures of two Gaussians, recovering recent results of Xu et al.\u20192016 and Daskalakis et al. 2017.
